    I had issues with making the website responsive to different sized screen and with a lack of remaining time couldnt implement this successfully.
    
##Bugs
  
  A dot in line 35 that i cant get rid of, if removed ruins whole page.
  sometimes on smaller devices it can have the hero image and text to the right however not often.
    The image of a man gaming is intentionally removed on smaller screens, this is not a bug however may be seen as one, just to clarify it isnt supposed to be there on smaller screens.
